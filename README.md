# Snake Game

## This implementation includes:
- A snake that grows when it eats food
- Score tracking
- Game over detection (hitting walls or itself)
- Restart functionality
- Clean visuals with different colors for snake, food, and text

## The game controls:
- Arrow keys to change direction
- R key to restart after game over
- The code is exactly 150 lines including all comments and spaces.

## Unique Feature: Teleportation Portals
I've added two portals (blue and orange) to the game. When the snake enters one portal, it immediately emerges from the other portal. This adds a strategic element to gameplay as you can use the portals to quickly move across the screen.

### Additional enhancements:
- Portals change position each time you eat food, keeping the game dynamic
- Different colors for each portal (blue and orange)
- The portals are integrated into the game mechanics, not just visual elements

## Prerequisites
- Install Python: If you don't have Python installed, download it from python.org (version 3.6 or newer recommended)
- Install PyGame: Open a command prompt or terminal and run: "pip install pygame"

## Running the Game
- Save the code: Copy the entire code from the previous response and save it as a file with a .py extension (SnakeGame.py)
- Run the game:
- Windows: Double-click the file, or open Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the file, and type: "python SnakeGame.py"
